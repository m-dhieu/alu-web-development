# HTML Semantic Structure Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a **semantic HTML webpage** from a wireframe design provided via Figma. The goal is to create a clean, well-structured HTML document that accurately reflects the layout and content of the design, using appropriate semantic tags without any CSS styling at this stage.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what HTML is and its role in web development.
- Create an HTML page from a wireframe design, translating visual elements into semantic HTML tags.
- Explain what a markup language is and how HTML fits this definition.
- Describe the Document Object Model (DOM) and how HTML elements form its structure.
- Identify HTML elements, tags, and attributes and their purposes.
- Understand the semantic purpose of common HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.
- Write clean, valid, and W3C-compliant HTML code that validates successfully.

## Project Details

- **Design Source:** The webpage is based on a wireframe available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/sHt05Xab2DoyK26c2J40rI/Sample-template?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=1vXzYSE88KevwW6A-0).
- **Fonts:** The design uses *Source Sans Pro* and *Spin Cycle OT*. If these fonts are missing on your system, you can download them from official sources or Google Fonts.
- **Measurements:** Some design values are in floating-point numbers; feel free to round these values for simplicity and practicality in your HTML structure.
- **Restrictions:** This project focuses solely on HTML structure - no CSS or styling should be added at this stage.
- **Validation:** All HTML files must be W3C-compliant and pass validation with the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Important Notes

- The wireframe provides a visual guide; your task is to translate it into semantic HTML elements that convey meaning and structure.
- Use comments in your HTML files to mark sections and improve readability.
- Maintain consistent indentation and file formatting.
- Ensure all files end with a newline character.
- No external libraries or frameworks should be used.
- The README.md file is mandatory and should be placed at the root of the project directory.

## How to Use This Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML files in a modern browser to verify structure.
3. Use the W3C Validator to check for compliance.
4. Review the Figma wireframe alongside your HTML to ensure accuracy.
5. Prepare for future projects where CSS and JavaScript will be added to enhance styling and interactivity.
